# Strategy & Assumptions

## 1. Balance Sheet First (Housing & Liquidity)

### Strategy

- Primary residence in Australia is purchased outright.
- No non-deductible leverage is carried at any point.
- Housing equity is treated as illiquid and excluded from portfolio risk budgeting.
- Maintain 6–9 months of AUD liquidity during property transition and thereafter.

### Why

- Eliminates interest rate and refinancing risk.
- Preserves psychological and financial flexibility during market stress.
- Prevents forced asset sales due to timing or FX mismatches.

## 2. Employment Income as a Finite Stabiliser

### Strategy

- Ongoing employment income (~AUD 11k net per month) is assumed to fund all living expenses through 2027.
- Income is treated as a temporary stabilising asset with:
  - Finite duration
  - Employer-specific risk
- Portfolio construction assumes no portfolio withdrawals before 2027.

### Kill-Switch

If income visibility drops below 6 months or falls by >30%, capital preservation becomes the priority.

### Why

- Makes reliance on income explicit rather than implicit.
- Aligns portfolio risk with actual cashflow dependency.
- Prevents hidden leverage through income assumptions.

## 3. Capital Segmentation by Function

### Strategy

Capital is segmented by role, not asset class:

**Stabiliser Capital**

- **Purpose:** liquidity, inflation protection, and drawdown control.
- **Horizon:** 2027–2033.
- **Instruments:** AUD government bonds (nominal and indexed), laddered.

**Compounder Capital**

- **Purpose:** maximise absolute real returns over 20+ years.
- **Focus:** total return via durable, high-ROIC businesses and diversified global equity exposure.
- **Expected real return:** 6–7% p.a. over the cycle.

**Optionality Capital**

- **Purpose:** exploit regime change or dislocation over 12–18 months.
- Strictly limited downside with asymmetric upside.

### Why

- Prevents role confusion (e.g. yield assets masquerading as optionality).
- Allows different risk tolerances and evaluation metrics per bucket.

---

## 4. Return Expectations & Risk Budget

### Strategy

- Portfolio is designed around real (after-inflation) returns, not nominal targets.
- Concentration is permitted only where:
  - Capital allocation skill is demonstrable, and
  - Downside does not impair overall plan viability.
- No single position or macro factor is allowed to dominate total outcomes.

### Why

- Avoids overstated return assumptions.
- Ensures survivability across multiple macro regimes.
- Keeps conviction from becoming unpriced risk.

---

## 5. Definition of True Optionality

### Strategy

Optionality capital must exhibit at least two of the following:

- Convex payoff (limited downside, large upside)
- Positive exposure to volatility or dislocation
- Low correlation to equity beta in stress

Instruments are classified as Optionality if their expected payoff is meaningfully convex (i.e., upside increases disproportionately in dislocation), even if they have incidental carry.

Yield, carry, or spread compression alone does not qualify as optionality.

### Why

- Prevents slow capital erosion with poor crisis performance.
- Ensures optionality pays off when the base case fails.
- Aligns instruments with the stated time-arbitrage objective.

---

## 6. Currency Exposure Philosophy

### Strategy

- AUD-denominated assets are used for:
  - Liability matching
  - Near-term spending needs
- A portion of long-term growth capital is held unhedged internationally.

### Principle

- **Hedged exposure** = cashflow and volatility management
- **Unhedged exposure** = regime insurance and real purchasing power protection

### Why

- Protects against Australia-specific downturns and AUD weakness.
- Reduces dependence on correct macro and policy forecasting.
- Improves real return stability over long horizons.

---

## 7. Stress & Correlation Awareness

### Strategy

The portfolio must remain functional under scenarios such as:

- Global equity drawdown
- Commodity cycle reversal
- AUD appreciation or depreciation
- Credit spread widening

No single scenario is allowed to force liquidation of long-term assets.

### Why

- Ensures resilience rather than optimisation for one macro view.
- Converts abstract diversification into practical drawdown control.

---

## 8. Review Triggers (Not Calendar Reviews)

### Strategy

Portfolio structure is reviewed only if:

- Income assumptions materially change
- Inflation or rate regime shifts structurally
- Asset correlations converge unexpectedly
- Capital role boundaries are breached

### Why

- Avoids reactive tinkering.
- Focuses attention on regime change, not noise.
